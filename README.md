# Sigil

**This is a temporary readme because I didn't have time to write a proper one yet**

> Sigil is a token-compressed memory format for Agents with up to 33x lossless compression (currently only tested in claude code). 

It encodes behavioral rules, project context, references, and user preferences in ~8–16 tokens per entry (vs ~30 tokens in prose), with empirically validated 100% decode accuracy.

**Format example:**
```
Legend: 🚫=never, ▸=prefer-over

GIT: commit-single-m-flag, wrap(env -i), 🚫bg, 🌳worktree
STY: give-todo+user-implements, 🚫workaround, 🚫tangent
TSX: switch-default(x satisfies never), Record<Enum,T>
```

Sigil is meant to be writable by humans but not necessarily readable. 

## Installation

Copy three things into your Claude Code user directory (`~/.claude/`):

### 1. Commands (slash commands)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands/sigil
cp commands/init.md ~/.claude/commands/sigil/init.md
cp commands/remember.md ~/.claude/commands/sigil/remember.md
```

### 2. Skill (syntax reference)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/remember/references
cp skills/remember/SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/remember/SKILL.md
cp skills/remember/references/sigil-syntax.md ~/.claude/skills/remember/references/sigil-syntax.md
```

### 3. Verify

Restart Claude Code (or open a new session) and check that the commands are listed:

```
/sigil:remember    — save a memory in Sigil format
/sigil:init        — migrate all existing memories to Sigil format
```

## Forge Integration

Forge is a terminal-based coding harness that's fully compatible with Sigil skills. Skills from Claude Code work directly in Forge without any conversion.

### How Forge Reads Memories

Forge automatically reads these locations in order:

| Priority | Path | Contents |
|----------|------|----------|
| 1 | `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` | Global rules, user identity, tool preferences |
| 2 | `~/.forge/memory/MEMORY.md` | Compressed Sigil memories (if exists) |
| 3 | `.forge/projects/*/memory/MEMORY.md` | Project-specific memories |

### Installation for Forge

**Copy skills directly** (fully compatible with Claude Code):

```bash
# Global skills (available across all projects)
mkdir -p ~/forge/skills
cp -r skills/remember ~/forge/skills/

# Optional: Create Sigil memory file
mkdir -p ~/forge/memory
touch ~/forge/memory/MEMORY.md
```

**Alternative: Project-specific skills:**

```bash
# In your project directory
mkdir -p .forge/skills
cp -r skills/remember .forge/skills/remember
```

### Forge Skills Locations

```
.forge/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md    ← Project skills (highest)
~/.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md ← Agent skills
~/forge/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md   ← Global skills
```

### Verify Installation

Run `:skill` in Forge to see available skills:

```
:skill
```

Look for `remember` and `init` skills.

### Tips for Forge-Friendly Memories

- **Use domain codes**: `GIT:`, `STY:`, `TSX:`, `PRJ:`, `REF:`, `USR:`
- **Be specific**: `commit-single-m-flag` not `good-commits`
- **Include examples**: `wrap(env -i)` not just `env-prefix`
- **Use `Legend:` line**: Required for `▸` to decode correctly
- **Keep AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md updated**: Read first by Forge

## Usage

### Save a memory

```
/sigil:remember never use let, always const
```

Or just describe it naturally:

```
/sigil:remember the API auth uses Bearer tokens from process.env.API_KEY
```

Claude compresses it into Sigil and appends to your `MEMORY.md`.

### Migrate existing memories (one-time)

```
/sigil:init
```

Scans all your memory locations, shows a before/after compression table with token counts, waits for confirmation, then rewrites everything in Sigil format. Backs up originals to `~/.claude/backups/sigil/memories/` before overwriting.

---

## How it works

Sigil uses a small set of symbolic operators on top of readable words:

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `🚫X` | never do X | `🚫mock-db` |
| `A▸B` | prefer A over B | `Read▸paste` |
| `verb(detail)` | do verb with specifics | `wrap(env -i)` |
| `X→Y` | X leads to / causes Y | `auth-rewrite→compliance` |
| `X@Y` | X at location Y | `pipeline-bugs@Linear(INGEST)` |
| `X+Y` | X and Y | `give-todo+user-implements` |
| `X∈Y` | X inside Y | `[[xlinks]]∈bullets` |

Rules:
- Always include a `Legend:` line — it's load-bearing for `▸`
- Use 3-letter uppercase domain codes (GIT, STY, TSX, PRJ, REF, USR)
- Keep words readable — vowel stripping kills accuracy
- Use parenthetical examples for ambiguous rules: `switch-default(x satisfies never)` not just `satisfies-never`

See `skills/remember/references/sigil-syntax.md` for the full reference.

## Smart Hooks (optional but recommended)

Two hooks that trigger Sigil at the right moments automatically.

### Hook 1: PreCompact — save before context is lost

Fires when you run `/compact`. Injects a message telling Claude to call `/sigil:remember` before the context window is cleared.

### Hook 2: Context-aware checkpoint

Fires after each Claude response. When context usage reaches 80%, shows a reminder to save session learnings.

> **Note:** The checkpoint hook reads context usage from `/tmp/statusline-debug.json`. This file is written by a custom statusline command. If you don't have one configured, the hook exits silently.

### Full hooks block for settings.json

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreCompact": [
      {
        "matcher": "manual",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "printf '{\"hookSpecificOutput\":{\"hookEventName\":\"PreCompact\",\"additionalContext\":\"Before compacting: run /sigil:remember to persist any important decisions, corrections, or patterns from this session into compressed memory.\"}}'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/sigil-checkpoint.sh",
            "timeout": 5
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Agent Memory Hierarchy

```

~/.claude/projects/*/memory/MEMORY.md ← Project-specific
./.claude/memory/MEMORY.md           ← Current workspace
```

## Background

The format was developed through 14 rounds of compression experiments testing 37 subagent passes across 16 coding rules and 50 cross-domain rules. The winning format (Round 14A) achieves:

- **3.9× compression** on technical rules (132 tokens vs 516 prose)
- **100% decode accuracy** across all validation passes (zero errors in 406 total rule decodes)
